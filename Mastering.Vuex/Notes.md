# Mastering Vuex

[The course is available here](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/mastering-vuex).

## Intro to Vuex

- State is the single source of truth.
- Let's compare the Vue instance to Vuex:

| Vue instance | Vuex    |
| ------------ | ------- |
| data         | state   |
| methods      | actions |
| computed     | getters |

The store has also `mutations` called by `actions` to update the `store` to ease the debugging.
