# Next-Level Vue 2

See [starting code](https://vuemastery-nextlevelvue-by-jeremiel.netlify.app/).

## Progress bar: axios interceptors

The goal is to implement a mean to let the user know that data is loading.

The course uses [NProgress](https://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/).

Using `json-server`, we can slow down the api call with `-d` option.

`json-server -d 1500 db.json`

However, there are 2 issues :

1/ this is not optimal for multiple api calls.

The solution is to start the progress bar on the first call and end it on the last api call to load the view.

For that we will use a Vuex module.

2/ the view template is loaded before the data. We don't want that.

### Other usages of interceptors

- On request, set authorization tokens
- On response, format or filter the date before it reaches into your app.
- On response, catch your api errors.

## In-component Route guards

See [demo](https://vuemastery-nextlevelvue-incomponentguards-by-jeremiel.netlify.app/).

Vue provides lifecycle hook methods:

- `beforeCreate()`
- `created()`
- `beforeMount()`
- `mounted()`
- `beforeUpdate()`
- `updated()`
- `beforeDetroy()`
- `detroyed()`

With Vue router, we add 3 more methods, called _Route Navigation Guards_:

- `beforeRouteEnter(routeTo, routeFrom, next)`
  - called before `created`, so no access to `this` in the component.
- `beforeRouteUpdate(routeTo, routeFrom, next)`
- `beforeRouteLeave(routeTo, routeFrom, next)`

- `routeTo` is the route we are going to.
- `routeFrom` is the route we are coming from.
- `next` is a function that must be called to the resolve the hook.

See [docs](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/navigation-guards.html#in-component-guards).

## Global and Per-Route guards

It can help us remove the use of the state in the components.

We can use two guards:

```js
//run before navigating to the component
router.beforeEach((to, from, next) => {
  next();
});

//run right before the component is created (but after beforeRouteEnter?)
router.afterEach((to, from) => {
  console.log(to, from);
});
```

We set them the router file.

The per-route guard is `beforeEnter` set on the route object.

- it runs after `beforeEach` and before `beforeRouteEnter`

## Completing our Progress bar

`beforeEnter` is **only called** when the component is reused!

But soon `beforeResolve` will come to solve that.

For now, we will use the in-component guards `beforeRouteEnter` (when the component is created) and `beforeRouteUpdate` (when the component is reloaded).

## Error Handling

See [demo](https://vuemastery-nextlevelvue-globalandperrouteguard-by-jeremiel.netlify.app/).

This deals with httpÂ§/xxx page, for ex 404, and other errors.

```js
routes = {
  {
    path: "/network-issue",
    name: "network-issue",
    component: NetworkIssue,
    props: true,
  },
  {
    path: "/page-not-found",
    name: "page-not-found",
    component: PageNotFound,
    props: true,//to pass on some data to tell the source of the problem.
  },
  {
    path: "*",
    redirect: {
      name: "page-not-found",
      params: { resource: "page", value: "" },
    },
  },
}
```

The usage would be on a route:

```js
beforeEnter(to, from, next) {
      store
        .dispatch("event/fetchEvent", to.params.id)
        .then((event) => {
          console.log("item fetched...");
          to.params.event = event;
          next();
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          ErrorHandler.Handle404VsConnectivity(next, err, to);
        });
    }
```

where `Handle404VsConnectivity` is :

```js
function Handle404VsConnectivity(next, err, routeTo) {
  console.error(err);
  if (err.response && err.response.status === 404) {
    next({
      name: "page-not-found",
      params: { resource: "event", value: routeTo.params.id },
    });
  } else {
    next({
      name: "network-issue",
    });
  }
}
```

## Reusable Form components: BaseInput

See [demo](https://vuemastery-nextlevelvue-reusableformcomponents-by-jeremiel.netlify.app/).

It assumes that we use the automatic component registration in `main.js`. See [the docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/cookbook/automatic-global-registration-of-base-components.html#base-example).

So we need to send from the base input component the data typed by the user using `this.$emit`.

The parent will listen to it like so:

```html
<BaseInput
  label="Title"
  type="text"
  placeholder="Add an event title"
  v-model="event.title"
/>
```

where `v-model="event.title"` is a shorthand for:

```html
<BaseInput label="Title" type="text" placeholder="Add an event title"
:value="event.title @input="(value) => {event.title = value}" />
```

Also, if you want to pass on native attributes to a HTML element, like `type` and `placeholder` on `input`, then we just pass it in the component element and use `v-bind="$attrs"`.

```html
<base-input
  class="field"
  label="Location"
  type="text"
  placeholder="Add a location"
  v-model="event.location"
/>

<div>
  <label v-if="label" for="">{{ label }}</label>
  <select @input="updateValue" v-bind="$attrs">
    <option v-for="option in options" :key="option">{{ option }}</option>
  </select>
</div>
```

Note: `v-bind="$attrs"` will work on a child element only if the component has `inheritAttrs: false`

However, **this doesn't work for `style` and `class` attributes** in Vue2! Instead, you must use `props`.

## Reusable Form components: BaseSelect

It is very similar to the `BaseInput`.

For multi-selection, see the [vue-multiselect library](https://vue-multiselect.js.org/).

## Reusable Form components: BaseButton

The directive `v-on="$listeners"` helps us use the button more broadly, e.g. not only in a form.

```html
<button v-on="$listeners"><!-- inheriting event listeners --></button>
```

## Form Validation with Vuevalidate

See the library [through this link](https://vuelidate.js.org/).

See the example from the course [through this link](https://github.com/JeremieLitzler/vuemastery-projects/blob/ResuableFormComponents/src/views/ExampleVuelidate.vue).
